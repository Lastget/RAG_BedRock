Business\\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated herein by reference contain forward-looking statements based on expectations,\\nestimates, and projections as of the date of this filing. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements.\\nSee Item 1A of Part I — “Risk Factors.” As used herein, “Amazon.com,” “we,” “our,” and similar terms include Amazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless\\nthe context indicates otherwise.\\nGeneral\\nWe seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. We are guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for\\ninvention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of\\nconsumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, content creators, advertisers, and employees.\\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). These segments reflect the\\nway the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. Information on our net sales is contained in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial\\nStatements and Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segment Information.”\\nConsumers\\nWe serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We design our stores to enable hundreds of\\nmillions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product categories. Customers access our offerings through our websites,\\nmobile apps, Alexa, devices, streaming, and physically visiting our stores. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle, Fire tablet, Fire\\nTV, Echo, Ring, Blink, and eero, and we develop and produce media content. We seek to offer our customers low prices, fast and free delivery, easy-to-use\\nfunctionality, and timely customer service. In addition, we offer subscription services such as Amazon Prime, a membership program that includes fast, free\\nshipping on tens of millions of items, access to award-winning movies and series, and other benefits.\\nWe fulfill customer orders in a number of ways, including through: North America and International fulfillment networks that we operate; co-sourced and\\noutsourced arrangements in certain countries; digital delivery; and through our physical stores. We operate customer service centers globally, which are\\nsupplemented by co-sourced arrangements. See Item 2 of Part I, “Properties.”\\nSellers\\nWe offer programs that enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using our services. We are not the seller\\nof record in these transactions. We earn fixed fees, a percentage of sales, per-unit activity fees, interest, or some combination thereof, for our seller programs.\\nDevelopers and Enterprises\\nWe serve developers and enterprises of all sizes, including start-ups, government agencies, and academic institutions, through AWS, which offers a broad\\nset of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other services.\\nContent Creators\\nWe offer programs that allow authors, independent publishers, musicians, filmmakers, Twitch streamers, skill and app developers, and others to publish\\nand sell content.\\nAdvertisers\\nWe provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video\\nadvertising.\\n3', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nCompetition\\nOur businesses encompass a large variety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The worldwide marketplace in which we compete is\\nevolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industry sectors around the world. Our current and\\npotential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the\\nproducts we offer and sell to consumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and interactive media of all types and all\\ndistribution channels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online and app-based means of\\ndiscovering, using, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide e-commerce services,\\nincluding website development and hosting, omnichannel sales, inventory and supply chain management, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and\\npayment processing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies\\nthat provide information technology services or products, including on-premises or cloud-based infrastructure and other services; (7) companies that design,\\nmanufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, and electronic devices; (8) companies that sell grocery products online and in physical\\nstores; and (9) companies that provide advertising services, whether in digital or other formats. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our retail\\nbusinesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services\\ninclude the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers’ ability and willingness to change business practices. Some of our\\ncurrent and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to\\nour various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive distribution agreements that restrict our\\naccess to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more resources to\\ntechnology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. The internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new,\\nsmaller, or lesser-known businesses to compete against us. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the development of new business models\\nand the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive\\npositions.\\nIntellectual Property\\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual\\nproperty as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements\\nwith our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S.\\nand international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering\\ncertain of our proprietary technology.\\nSeasonality\\nOur business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31.\\nHuman Capital\\nOur employees are critical to our mission of being Earth’s most customer-centric company. As of December 31, 2023, we employed approximately\\n1,525,000 full-time and part-time employees. Additionally, we use independent contractors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. Competition\\nfor qualified personnel is intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff, and constrained labor markets have\\nincreased competition for personnel across other parts of our business.\\nAs we strive to be Earth’s best employer, we focus on investment and innovation, inclusion and diversity, safety, and engagement to hire and develop the\\nbest talent. We rely on numerous and evolving initiatives to implement these objectives and invent mechanisms for talent development, including competitive\\npay and benefits, flexible work arrangements, and skills training and educational programs such as Amazon Career Choice (education funding for eligible\\nemployees) and the Amazon Technical Academy (software development engineer training). Over 175,000 Amazon employees around the world have\\nparticipated in Career Choice. We also continue to inspect and refine the mechanisms we use to hire, develop, evaluate, and retain our employees to promote\\nequity for all candidates and employees. In addition, safety is integral to everything we do at Amazon and we continue to invest in safety improvements such as\\ncapital improvements, new safety technology, vehicle safety controls, and engineering ergonomic solutions. Our safety team is dedicated to using the science of\\nsafety to solve complex problems and establish new industry best practices. We also provide mentorship and support resources to our employees, and have\\ndeployed numerous programs that advance employee engagement, communication, and feedback.\\n4', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nAvailable Information\\nOur investor relations website is amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us.

Risk Factors\\nPlease carefully consider the following discussion of significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky. The\\nevents and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, recognize, or control, have a\\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results (including components of our financial results),\\ncash flows, liquidity, and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors, events, or\\nuncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. In addition to the factors\\ndiscussed in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and in the risk factors below, global\\neconomic and geopolitical conditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of the risks\\ndiscussed below. Many of the risks discussed below also impact our customers, including third-party sellers, which could indirectly have a material adverse\\neffect on us.\\nBusiness and Industry Risks\\nWe Face Intense Competition\\nOur businesses are rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors across geographies, including cross-border competition,\\nand in different industries, including physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, web and infrastructure computing services,\\nelectronic devices, digital content, advertising, grocery, and transportation and logistics services. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater\\nresources, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched products and services and in our newer\\ngeographic regions. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt more aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure,\\nfulfillment, and marketing.\\nCompetition continues to intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors, and as\\nour competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our\\nbusiness. In addition, new and enhanced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, practical applications of artificial\\nintelligence and machine learning, digital content, and electronic devices continue to increase our competition. The internet facilitates competitive entry and\\ncomparison shopping, which enhances the ability of new, smaller, or lesser known businesses to compete against us. As a result of competition, our product and\\nservice offerings may not be successful, we may fail to gain or may lose business, and we may be required to increase our spending or lower prices, any of\\nwhich could materially reduce our sales and profits.\\nOur Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Risks\\nWe may have limited or no experience in our newer market segments, and our customers may not adopt our product or service offerings. These offerings,\\nwhich can present new and difficult technology challenges, may subject us to claims if customers of these offerings experience, or are otherwise impacted by,\\nservice disruptions, delays, setbacks, or failures or quality issues. In addition, profitability or other intended benefits, if any, in our newer activities may not\\nmeet our expectations, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our investments in them, which investments are often\\nsignificant. Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the\\n6', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nvalue of those investments being written down or written off. In addition, our sustainability initiatives may be unsuccessful for a variety of reasons, including if\\nwe are unable to realize the expected benefits of new technologies or if we do not successfully plan or execute new strategies, which could harm our business\\nor damage our reputation.\\nOur International Operations Expose Us to a Number of Risks\\nOur international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further expand internationally. In certain international market\\nsegments, we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establish,\\ndevelop, and maintain international operations and stores, and promote our brand internationally. Our international operations may not become profitable on a\\nsustained basis.\\nIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\\n•local economic and political conditions;\\n•government regulation (such as regulation of our product and service offerings and of competition); restrictive governmental actions (such as trade\\nprotection measures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs, and restrictions around the import and export of certain\\nproducts, technologies, and components); nationalization; and restrictions on foreign ownership;\\n•restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liability for products, services, and content, including\\nuncertainty as a result of less internet-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices\\nregarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights;\\n•business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic devices;\\n•limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions;\\n•limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure;\\n•shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow;\\n•laws and regulations regarding privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, payments,\\nadvertising, and restrictions on pricing or discounts;\\n•lower levels of use of the internet;\\n•lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.;\\n•lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk;\\n•difficulty in staffing, developing, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences;\\n•different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions;\\n•compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government\\nofficials and other third parties;\\n•laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and\\n•geopolitical events, including war and terrorism.\\nAs international physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services grow, competition will intensify, including through\\nadoption of evolving business models. Local companies may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on,\\nthe local customer, as well as their more established local brand names. The inability to hire, train, retain, and manage sufficient required personnel may limit\\nour international growth.\\nThe People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and India regulate Amazon’s and its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and\\nlicense requirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors,\\n(ii) internet content, and (iii) the sale of media and other products and services. For example, in order to meet local ownership, regulatory licensing, and\\ncybersecurity requirements, we provide certain technology services in China through contractual relationships with third parties that hold PRC licenses to\\nprovide services. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multi-brand retail\\ntrading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver\\nto customers, and we hold an indirect minority interest in an entity that is a third-party seller on the www.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these\\nstructures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC and India may from time to time consider and implement additional\\nchanges in\\n7', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\ntheir regulatory, licensing, or other requirements that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation\\nof PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, our Chinese and\\nIndian businesses and operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or, in China, enforce\\ncontractual relationships we or our affiliates have in place. Violation of any existing or future PRC, Indian, or other laws or regulations or changes in the\\ninterpretations of those laws and regulations could result in our businesses in those countries being subject to fines and other financial penalties, having licenses\\nrevoked, or being forced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely.\\nIn addition, because China-based sellers account for significant portions of our third-party seller services and advertising revenues, and China-based\\nsuppliers provide significant portions of our components and finished goods, regulatory and trade restrictions, data protection and cybersecurity laws, economic\\nfactors, geopolitical events, security issues, or other factors negatively impacting China-based sellers and suppliers could adversely affect our operating results.\\nThe Variability in Our Retail Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations\\nDemand for our products and services can fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including as a result of seasonality, promotions, product launches, or\\nunforeseeable events, such as in response to global economic conditions such as recessionary fears or rising inflation, natural or human-caused disasters\\n(including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), or geopolitical events. For example, we expect a disproportionate\\namount of our retail sales to occur during our fourth quarter. Our failure to stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet\\ncustomer demand could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. When we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory\\nmarkdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could materially reduce profitability. We regularly experience increases in our net shipping cost\\ndue to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many\\ncustomers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites\\nunavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we offer or sell and the attractiveness of our products and\\nservices. In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and\\nother fulfillment companies and customer service co-sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. Risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating\\nto fulfillment network optimization and inventory are magnified during periods of high demand.\\nAs a result of holiday sales, as of December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest\\nlevel (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities) because consumers primarily use credit cards in our stores\\nand the related receivables settle quickly. Typically, there is also a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of December 31 due to inventory purchases\\nand third-party seller sales. Our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year as vendors and sellers are paid, resulting\\nin a corresponding decline in our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances.\\nWe Are Impacted by Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sellers\\nThe law relating to the liability of online service providers is currently unsettled. In addition, governmental agencies have in the past and could in the\\nfuture require changes in the way this business is conducted. Under our seller programs, we maintain policies and processes designed to prevent sellers from\\ncollecting payments, fraudulently or otherwise, when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the products received are materially different\\nfrom the sellers’ descriptions, and to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods, selling\\ngoods in an unlawful or unethical manner, violating the proprietary rights of others, or otherwise violating our policies. When these policies and processes are\\ncircumvented or fail to operate sufficiently, it can harm our business or damage our reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful\\nactivities by our sellers. Under our A-to-z Guarantee, we may reimburse customers for payments up to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party\\nseller sales grow, the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results.\\nWe Face Risks Related to Adequately Protecting Our Intellectual Property Rights and Being Accused of Infringing Intellectual Property Rights of Third\\nParties\\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual property as\\ncritical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our\\nemployees, customers, and others to protect our proprietary rights. Effective intellectual property protection is not available in every country in which our\\nproducts and services are made available. We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which we do business.\\nFurthermore, regulations governing domain names may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. We may be\\n8', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nunable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary\\nrights.\\nWe are not always able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Actions taken by third parties that license\\nour proprietary rights may materially diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property requires the\\nexpenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property do not always adequately protect\\nour rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently\\ndevelop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights.\\nWe have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual\\nproperty rights of third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, have in the past, and may in the future, result in the expenditure of significant financial\\nand managerial resources, injunctions against us, or significant payments for damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligations or to obtain licenses\\nfrom third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights. Such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. These risks have been\\namplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. In addition, our and our customers’ use of artificial\\nintelligence may result in increased claims of infringement or other claims, including those based on unauthorized use of third-party technology or content.\\nOur digital content offerings depend in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. Breach or\\nmalfunctioning of the digital rights management technology that we use could subject us to claims, and content providers may be unwilling to include their\\ncontent in our service.\\nWe Have Foreign Exchange Risk\\nThe results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international stores and product and service offerings are\\nexposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Due to these fluctuations, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record\\nsignificant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate\\nfluctuations has increased. We also hold cash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies such as British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros,\\nand Japanese Yen. When the U.S. Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may\\nbe materially less than expected and vice versa.\\nOperating Risks\\nOur Expansion Places a Significant Strain on our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources\\nWe are continuing to rapidly and significantly expand our global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our\\ninfrastructure to support our retail and services businesses. The complexity of the current scale of our business can place significant strain on our management,\\npersonnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions, and our expansion increases\\nthese factors. Failure to manage growth effectively could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\\nWe Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and Growth Rate\\nWe are not always able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion\\nof our expenses and investments is fixed, and we are not always able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected.\\nOur revenue growth may not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the\\ncontinued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our business is affected by, among other things, general economic,\\nbusiness, and geopolitical conditions worldwide. A softening of demand, whether caused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or\\nglobal economies, may result in decreased revenue or growth.\\nOur sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, including due to factors described elsewhere in this section and the following:\\n•our ability to retain and increase sales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers’ demands;\\n•our ability to retain and expand our network of sellers;\\n•our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, and fulfill orders;\\n•the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases, or improvements;\\n9', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\n•changes in usage or adoption rates of the internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and web services, including outside the U.S.;\\n•timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure;\\n•the success of our geographic, service, and product line expansions;\\n•the extent to which we finance, and the terms of any such financing for, our current operations and future growth;\\n•the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, which may include significant monetary damages or injunctive relief and could have a material\\nadverse impact on our operating results;\\n•variations in the mix of products and services we sell;\\n•variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns;\\n•the extent to which we offer fast and free delivery, continue to reduce prices worldwide, and provide additional benefits to our customers;\\n•factors affecting our reputation or brand image (including any actual or perceived inability to achieve our goals or commitments, whether related to\\nsustainability, customers, employees, or other topics), and public perceptions regarding social or ethical issues related to our development and use of\\nartificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, products, and services;\\n•the extent to which we invest in technology and infrastructure, fulfillment, and other expense categories;\\n•availability of and increases in the prices of transportation (including fuel), resources such as land, water, and energy, commodities like paper and\\npacking supplies and hardware products, and technology infrastructure products, including as a result of inflationary pressures;\\n•constrained labor markets, which increase our payroll costs;\\n•the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and\\nunconstrained access to our online services;\\n•our ability to collect amounts owed to us when they become due;\\n•the extent to which new and existing technologies, or industry trends, restrict online advertising or affect our ability to customize advertising or\\notherwise tailor our product and service offerings;\\n•the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware, viruses, phishing and other spam emails, denial of service attacks, data theft, computer\\nintrusions, outages, and similar events;\\n•the extent to which we fail to maintain our unique culture of innovation, customer obsession, and long-term thinking, which has been critical to our\\ngrowth and success;\\n•disruptions from natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change),\\ngeopolitical events and security issues (including terrorist attacks, armed hostilities, and political conflicts, including those involving China), labor or\\ntrade disputes (including restrictive governmental actions impacting us, our customers, and our third-party sellers and suppliers in China or other\\nforeign countries), and similar events; and\\n•potential negative impacts of climate change, including: increased operating costs due to more frequent extreme weather events or climate-related\\nchanges, such as rising temperatures and water scarcity; increased investment requirements associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy;\\ndecreased demand for our products and services as a result of changes in customer behavior; increased compliance costs due to more extensive and\\nglobal regulations and third-party requirements; and reputational damage resulting from perceptions of our environmental impact.\\nWe Face Risks Related to Successfully Optimizing and Operating Our Fulfillment Network and Data Centers\\nFailures to adequately predict customer demand and consumer spending patterns or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data\\ncenters successfully from time to time result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity, service interruptions, increased costs, and impairment\\ncharges, any of which could materially harm our business. As we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with different\\nrequirements, our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance\\nthat we will be able to operate our networks effectively.\\n10', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nIn addition, failure to optimize inventory management or staffing in our fulfillment network increases our net shipping cost by increasing the distance\\nproducts are shipped and reducing the number of units per shipment or delivery. We and our co-sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment\\nnetwork and customer service centers. For example, productivity across our fulfillment network is affected by regional labor market constraints, which increase\\npayroll costs and make it difficult to hire, train, and deploy a sufficient number of people to operate our fulfillment network as efficiently as we would like.\\nUnder some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and\\noperating our fulfillment network. Our failure to adequately predict seller demand for storage or to properly handle such inventory or the inability of the other\\nbusinesses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services to accurately forecast product demand may result in us being unable to secure sufficient\\nstorage space or to optimize our fulfillment network or cause other unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation.\\nWe rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. An inability to negotiate acceptable\\nterms with these companies or performance problems, staffing limitations, or other difficulties experienced by these companies or by our own transportation\\nsystems, including as a result of labor market constraints and related costs, could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience. In addition,\\nour ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negatively affected by natural or human-caused\\ndisasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues, labor or trade\\ndisputes, and similar events.\\nWe Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches\\nBecause we collect, process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including confidential, classified, sensitive, proprietary, and business and personal\\ninformation, failure to prevent or mitigate data loss, theft, misuse, unauthorized access, or other security breaches or vulnerabilities affecting our or our\\nvendors’ or customers’ technology, products, and systems, could: expose us or our customers to a risk of loss, disclosure, or misuse of such information;\\nadversely affect our operating results; result in litigation, liability, or regulatory action (including under laws related to privacy, data use, data protection, data\\nsecurity, network security, and consumer protection); deter customers or sellers from using our stores, products, and services; and otherwise harm our business\\nand reputation. We use third-party technology and systems for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology,\\nemployee email, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and other functions. Some of our systems have experienced past security breaches, and,\\nalthough they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance that future incidents will not have material adverse\\neffects on our operations or financial results. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer data and prevent such\\nincidents, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor or customer, such measures cannot\\nprovide absolute security and may fail to operate as intended or be circumvented.\\nWe Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy\\nWe experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and prevent us from\\nefficiently accepting or fulfilling orders or providing services to customers and third parties, which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our\\nproducts and services. Steps we take to add software and hardware, upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and improve the stability and efficiency of\\nour systems may not be sufficient to avoid system interruptions or delays that could adversely affect our operating results.\\nOur computer and communications systems and operations in the past have been, or in the future could be, damaged or interrupted due to events such as\\nnatural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security\\nissues (including terrorist attacks and armed hostilities), computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, operational failures (including from energy\\nshortages), and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from\\naccepting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which could make our product and service offerings less attractive and subject us to liability.\\nOur systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. In addition, our insurance may not provide sufficient coverage to\\ncompensate for related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy.\\nThe Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel or the Failure to Hire and Retain Highly Skilled and Other Personnel Could Negatively Affect Our\\nBusiness\\nWe depend on our senior management and other key personnel, including our President and CEO. We do not have “key person” life insurance policies.\\nWe also rely on other highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the industries in which we operate, as well as senior management, has\\nhistorically been intense. For example, we experience\\n11', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nsignificant competition in the technology industry, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff. In addition, changes we\\nmake to our current and future work environments may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees or may be perceived as less favorable compared to\\nother companies’ policies, which could negatively impact our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other\\nkey employees, the failure to successfully transition key roles, or the inability to hire, train, retain, and manage qualified personnel, could harm our business.\\nWe also rely on a significant number of personnel to operate our stores, fulfillment network, and data centers and carry out our other operations. Failure\\nto successfully hire, train, manage, and retain sufficient personnel to meet our needs can strain our operations, increase payroll and other costs, and harm our\\nbusiness and reputation. In addition, changes in laws and regulations applicable to employees, independent contractors, and temporary personnel could increase\\nour payroll costs, decrease our operational flexibility, and negatively impact how we are able to staff our operations and supplement our workforce.\\nWe are also subject to labor union efforts to organize groups of our employees from time to time. These organizational efforts, if successful, decrease our\\noperational flexibility, which could adversely affect our operating efficiency. In addition, our response to any organizational efforts could be perceived\\nnegatively and harm our business and reputation.\\nOur Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks\\nWe have significant suppliers, including content and technology licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of supply, that are important to\\nour sourcing, services, manufacturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our\\nsuppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. Decisions by\\nour current suppliers to limit or stop selling or licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including\\nas a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural or human-caused disasters (including public health\\ncrises) or geopolitical events, or for other reasons, may result in our being unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner\\nand on acceptable terms, or at all. For example, we rely on a limited group of suppliers for semiconductor products, including products related to artificial\\nintelligence infrastructure such as graphics processing units. Constraints on the availability of these products could adversely affect our ability to develop and\\noperate artificial intelligence technologies, products, or services. In addition, violations by our suppliers or other vendors of applicable laws, regulations,\\ncontractual terms, intellectual property rights of others, or our Supply Chain Standards, as well as products or practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or\\nhazardous, could expose us to claims, damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.\\nOur Commercial Agreements, Strategic Alliances, and Other Business Relationships Expose Us to Risks\\nWe provide physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, cloud services, and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic\\nalliances, and business relationships. Under these agreements, we provide web services, technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services,\\nas well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our stores. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity,\\npersonnel, and other resource commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop\\nthe components of these commercial relationships, which may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, inventory management, tax collection,\\npayment processing, hardware, content, and third-party software, and engaging third parties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under\\ncertain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales. Therefore, when the other company’s offerings are not\\nsuccessful, the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into\\nadditional or alternative commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms.

We may in the future enter into\\namendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our\\noperating results.\\nOur present and future commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships create additional risks such as:\\n•disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;\\n•impairment of other relationships;\\n•variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and\\n•difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements.\\n12', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nOur Business Suffers When We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Acquisitions and Investments\\nWe have acquired and invested in a number of companies, and we may in the future acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional\\ncompanies. These transactions involve risks such as:\\n•disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;\\n•problems retaining key personnel;\\n•additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested;\\n•the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including as a result of acquisitions;\\n•the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a result of\\nany integration of operations;\\n•the difficulty of completing such transactions, including obtaining regulatory approvals or satisfying other closing conditions, and achieving\\nanticipated benefits within expected timeframes, or at all;\\n•the difficulty of incorporating acquired operations, technology, and rights into our offerings, and unanticipated expenses related to such integration;\\n•the difficulty of integrating a new company’s accounting, financial reporting, management, information and data security, human resource, and other\\nadministrative systems to permit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not successfully implemented;\\n•losses we may incur as a result of declines in the value of an investment or as a result of incorporating an investee’s financial performance into our\\nfinancial results;\\n•for investments in which an investee’s financial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in full or in part, or investments for\\nwhich we are required to file financial statements or provide financial information, the dependence on the investee’s accounting, financial reporting,\\nand similar systems, controls, and processes;\\n•the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger public company;\\n•the risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face;\\n•potential unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest; and\\n•for foreign transactions, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political,\\nand regulatory risks associated with specific countries.\\nAs a result of future acquisitions or mergers, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, contingent liabilities, or\\namortization expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms,\\nif at all. In addition, valuations supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly. We could determine that such valuations have\\nexperienced impairments or other-than-temporary declines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results.\\nWe Face Significant Inventory Risk\\nIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network and inventory optimization by us and third parties, we are exposed\\nto significant inventory risks that may adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles\\nand pricing, defective merchandise, changes in customer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products,\\nspoilage, and other factors. We endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell.\\nDemand for products, however, can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. In addition, when we\\nbegin selling or manufacturing a new product or offering a new service, it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or\\ncomponent selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components requires significant lead-time and\\nprepayment and they may not be returnable. We carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products, such as consumer electronics, and\\nat times we are unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or to meet demand during the relevant selling seasons. Any one of the inventory risk factors set\\nforth above may adversely affect our operating results.\\nWe Are Subject to Payments-Related Risks\\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, credit accounts (including promotional financing), gift cards, direct\\ndebit from a customer’s bank account, consumer invoicing, physical bank check, and payment\\n13', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nupon delivery. For existing and future payment options we offer to our customers, we currently are subject to, and may become subject to additional,\\nregulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and\\nreduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other\\nfees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide certain Amazon-branded payment\\nmethods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and promotional financing. In each case, it\\ncould disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We also offer co-branded credit card programs, which\\ncould adversely affect our operating results if renewed on less favorable terms or terminated. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules,\\nincluding data security rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it\\ndifficult or impossible for us to comply. Failure to comply with these rules or requirements, as well as any breach, compromise, or failure to otherwise detect or\\nprevent fraudulent activity involving our data security systems, could result in our being liable for card issuing banks’ costs, subject to fines and higher\\ntransaction fees, and loss of our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types\\nof online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\\nIn addition, we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to\\nthird parties, and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf. Jurisdictions subject us to requirements for licensing,\\nregulatory inspection, bonding and capital maintenance, the use, handling, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, maintaining or\\nprocessing data, and authentication. We are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money\\nlaundering, international money transfers, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, and\\nelectronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and\\ncriminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services.\\nWe Have a Rapidly Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highly Volatile\\nWe have a rapidly evolving business model. The trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to, among other risks, the risks\\ndescribed elsewhere in this Item 1A, as well as:\\n•changes in interest rates;\\n•conditions or trends in the internet and the industry segments we operate in;\\n•quarterly variations in operating results;\\n•fluctuations in the stock market in general and market prices for internet-related companies in particular;\\n•changes in financial estimates by us or decisions to increase or decrease future spending or investment levels;\\n•changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;\\n•changes in our capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public;\\n•changes in the valuation methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and\\n•transactions in our common stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, and speculation.\\nVolatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensation to employees\\nor grant larger stock awards than we have historically, which could hurt our operating results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders,\\nor both.\\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\\nGovernment Regulation Is Evolving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business\\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the internet, physical, e-commerce, and\\nomnichannel retail, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, artificial intelligence technologies and services, and other products and\\nservices that we offer or sell. These regulations and laws cover taxation, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security,\\nconsumer protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, transportation, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy\\nconsumption, environmental and climate-related regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, employment, trade and protectionist\\nmeasures, web services, the provision of online payment services, registration, licensing, and information reporting requirements, unencumbered internet\\naccess to our services or access to our facilities, the design and operation of websites, health, safety, and sanitation standards, the characteristics, legality, and\\nquality of products and services, product labeling, the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft systems, healthcare, and other matters. It is not clear how\\n14', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nexisting laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, and\\nconsumer protection apply to aspects of our operations such as the internet, e-commerce, digital content, web services, electronic devices, advertising, and\\nartificial intelligence technologies and services. A large number of jurisdictions regulate our operations, and the extent, nature, and scope of such regulations is\\nevolving and expanding as the scope of our businesses expand. We are regularly subject to formal and informal reviews, investigations, and other proceedings\\nby governments and regulatory authorities under existing laws, regulations, or interpretations or pursuing new and novel approaches to regulate our operations.\\nFor example, we face a number of open investigations based on claims that aspects of our operations infringe competition rules, including aspects of Amazon’s\\noperation of its stores including its fulfillment network, Amazon’s acquisitions, and certain aspects of AWS’s offering of cloud services. We strongly dispute\\nthese claims and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these investigations. Similarly, we face investigations under a growing patchwork of laws and\\nregulations governing the collection, use, and disclosure of data, the interpretation of which continues to evolve, leading to uncertainty about how regulators\\nwill view our privacy practices. In addition, regulators and lawmakers are increasingly focused on controlling additional aspects of the operations of\\ntechnology companies and companies they have characterized to be online “gatekeepers” through the application of existing regulations and laws and the\\nadoption of new regulations and laws, which increases our compliance costs and limits the operation of our business. Unfavorable regulations, laws, decisions,\\nor interpretations by government or regulatory authorities applying those laws and regulations, or inquiries, investigations, or enforcement actions threatened or\\ninitiated by them, could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary\\nfines), diminish the demand for, or availability of, our products and services, increase our cost of doing business, require us to change our business practices in\\na manner materially adverse to our business, damage our reputation, impede our growth, or otherwise have a material effect on our operations. The media,\\npolitical, and regulatory scrutiny we face, which may continue to increase, amplifies these risks.\\nClaims, Litigation, Government Investigations, and Other Proceedings May Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations\\nAs an innovative company offering a wide range of consumer and business products and services around the world, we are regularly subject to actual and\\nthreatened claims, litigation, reviews, investigations, and other proceedings, including proceedings by governments and regulatory authorities, involving a wide\\nrange of issues, including patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment (including the characterization of delivery drivers),\\ncompetition and antitrust, privacy, data use, data protection, data security, data localization, network security, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods\\nand services offered by us and by third parties (including artificial intelligence technologies and services), and other matters. The number and scale of these\\nproceedings have increased over time as our businesses have expanded in scope and geographic reach, as our products, services, and operations have become\\nmore complex and available to, and used by, more people, and as governments and regulatory authorities seek to regulate us on a pre-emptive basis. For\\nexample, we are litigating a number of matters alleging price fixing, monopolization, and consumer protection claims, including those brought by state\\nattorneys general and the Federal Trade Commission. Any of these types of proceedings can have an adverse effect on us because of legal costs, disruption of\\nour operations, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, and other factors. The outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and\\nsubject to significant uncertainties. Determining legal reserves or possible losses from such matters involves judgment and may not reflect the full range of\\nuncertainties and unpredictable outcomes. Until the final resolution of such matters, we may be exposed to losses in excess of the amount recorded, and such\\namounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material effect on our\\nbusiness, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings,\\nincluding as a result of a settlement, could involve licenses, sanctions, consent decrees, or orders requiring us to make substantial future payments, preventing\\nus from offering certain products or services, requiring us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, requiring\\ndevelopment of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies, damaging our reputation, or otherwise having a material effect on our operations.\\nWe Are Subject to Product Liability Claims When People or Property Are Harmed by the Products We Sell or Manufacture\\nSome of the products we sell or manufacture expose us to product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness, death, or\\nenvironmental or property damage, and can require product recalls or other actions. Third parties who sell products using our services and stores also expose us\\nto product liability claims. Additionally, under our A-to-z Guarantee, we may reimburse customers for certain product liability claims up to certain limits in\\nthese situations, and as our third-party seller sales grow, the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results. Although we\\nmaintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be\\navailable to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Although we impose contractual terms on sellers that are intended to prohibit sales of certain type of\\nproducts, we may not be able to detect, enforce, or collect sufficient damages for\\n15', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nbreaches of such agreements. In addition, some of our agreements with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability.\\nWe Face Additional Tax Liabilities and Collection Obligations\\nWe are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We may recognize\\nadditional tax expense and be subject to additional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws, regulations,\\nadministrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and\\naccounting rules in various jurisdictions. Such changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of\\njurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, including revenue-based taxes, targeting online\\ncommerce and the remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to withhold or collect sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes\\non online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations. For example, non-U.S. jurisdictions\\nhave proposed or enacted taxes on online advertising and marketplace service revenues. Proliferation of these or similar unilateral tax measures may continue\\nunless broader international tax reform is implemented. In addition, the European Union and other countries (including those in which we operate) have\\nenacted or have committed to enact global minimum taxes, which may increase our tax expense in future years.\\nOur results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional taxes imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes\\nor penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information about our customers, suppliers, and other third\\nparties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies. In some cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt\\nprocesses to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date.\\nOur tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new\\nbusinesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to\\nrealize related tax benefits, the applicability of special or extraterritorial tax regimes, changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to\\nour forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, and changes in our tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. In the\\nordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgment is\\nrequired in evaluating and estimating our tax expense, assets, and liabilities.\\nWe are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or\\nother tax controversy can have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for\\nprior and subsequent periods. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters, interpretations of certain tax laws by authorities, and judicial,\\nadministrative, and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such controversy may be materially different from our expectations.\\nFor example, the Indian tax authority has asserted that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to Amazon in the U.S. We are contesting this position; however, if\\nthis matter is adversely resolved, we may be required to pay additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the future could\\nincrease. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although\\nwe believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our\\nhistorical tax accruals.\\nWe Are Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Related Procurement Regulations\\nOur contracts with U.S., as well as state, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements\\nrelating to their formation, administration, and performance. We are subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any\\nviolations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, refunding or suspending of\\npayments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, some of these contracts are\\nsubject to periodic funding approval and/or provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause.\\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\\nNone.\\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\\nWe have processes in place for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from potential unauthorized occurrences on or through our electronic\\ninformation systems that could adversely affect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our information systems or the information residing on those\\nsystems. These include a wide variety of\\n16', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nmechanisms, controls, technologies, methods, systems, and other processes that are designed to prevent, detect, or mitigate data loss, theft, misuse,\\nunauthorized access, or other security incidents or vulnerabilities affecting the data. The data include confidential, proprietary, and business and personal\\ninformation that we collect, process, store, and transmit as part of our business, including on behalf of third parties. We also use systems and processes\\ndesigned to reduce the impact of a security incident at a third-party vendor or customer. Additionally, we use processes to oversee and identify material risks\\nfrom cybersecurity threats associated with our use of third-party technology and systems, including: technology and systems we use for encryption and\\nauthentication; employee email; content delivery to customers; back-office support; and other functions.\\nAs part of our risk management process, we conduct application security assessments, vulnerability management, penetration testing, security audits, and\\nongoing risk assessments. We also maintain a variety of incident response plans that are utilized when incidents are detected. We require employees with access\\nto information systems, including all corporate employees, to undertake data protection and cybersecurity training and compliance programs annually.\\nWe have a unified and centrally-coordinated team, led by our chief security officer, that is responsible for implementing and maintaining centralized\\ncybersecurity and data protection practices at Amazon in close coordination with senior leadership and other teams across Amazon. Reporting to our chief\\nsecurity officer are a number of experienced chief information security officers responsible for various parts of our business, including AWS, each of whom is\\nsupported by a team of trained cybersecurity professionals. In addition to our extensive in-house cybersecurity capabilities, at times we also engage assessors,\\nconsultants, auditors, or other third parties to assist with assessing, identifying, and managing cybersecurity risks.\\nOur cybersecurity risks and associated mitigations are evaluated by senior leadership, including as part of our enterprise risk assessments that are\\nreviewed by the Audit Committee and our Board of Directors. Such risks and mitigations are also subject to oversight by the Security Committee of our Board\\nof Directors. Additional information about cybersecurity risks we face is discussed in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors,” under the heading “We Could Be\\nHarmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches,” which should be read in conjunction with the information above.\\nThe Security Committee, which is comprised of independent directors, oversees our policies and procedures for protecting our cybersecurity\\ninfrastructure and for compliance with applicable data protection and security regulations, and related risks. The Security Committee receives reports regarding\\nsuch risks from management, including our chief security officer, and reports to the Board at least annually. The Security Committee also oversees the Board’s\\nresponse to any significant cybersecurity incidents.\\nOur chief security officer, who has extensive cybersecurity knowledge and skills gained from over 15 years of work experience on the security team at\\nAmazon and an extensive career in the technology and cybersecurity industries as a senior executive in the federal government, heads the team responsible for\\nimplementing and maintaining cybersecurity and data protection practices at Amazon and reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer.\\n17', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nItem 2.

In addition, global economic and geopolitical\\nconditions and additional or unforeseen circumstances, developments, or events may give rise to or amplify many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties,\\nas well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in\\ngreater detail in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.”\\nOverview\\nOur primary source of revenue is the sale of a wide range of products and services to customers. The products offered through our stores include\\nmerchandise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by third-party sellers, and we also manufacture and sell electronic devices and\\nproduce media content. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue\\nof items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numerous\\nproduct categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, advertising, publishing, and digital content\\nsubscriptions.\\nOur financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows. Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and\\nefficiently managing accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and\\nequipment. Increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs,\\npartially offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives, including capital expenditures focused on improving the customer experience. To\\nincrease sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availability,\\noffering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, producing original content, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding\\nproduct information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust. See “Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures”\\nbelow for additional information on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures.\\nWe seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment\\nprocessing and related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run\\nAWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and\\nadd features to our online stores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment network. Variable costs\\ngenerally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category\\nexpansion, and other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct\\nsourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize unnecessary growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process\\nefficiencies and maintain a lean culture.\\nWe seek to turn inventory quickly and collect from consumers before our payments to vendors and sellers become due. Because consumers primarily use\\ncredit cards in our stores, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous\\nfactors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of\\nproduct offerings, supply chain disruptions and resulting vendor lead times, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we\\nchoose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors,\\nincluding the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix\\n20', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nof suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment and other terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with\\nsuppliers.\\nWe expect spending in technology and infrastructure will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers,\\nand merchandising employees. Our technology and infrastructure investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service\\nofferings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology\\nand infrastructure, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in infrastructure to enhance the\\ncustomer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing\\npower, data storage and analytics, improved wireless connectivity, and the practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, will continue to\\nimprove users’ experience on the internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are\\ninvesting in AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage, database, analytics, and machine learning, and other\\nservices to developers and enterprises of all sizes. We are also investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic\\ndevices as well as other initiatives including the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing\\nservices.\\nWe seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings,\\nacquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders’ interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation\\nbecause we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include\\nall vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 10.6\\nbillion and 10.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2023.\\nOur financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated\\ntrends. For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating\\nexpenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our\\ninternational locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing\\ndiversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful\\nto evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes.\\nIn addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign\\nexchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated\\ntrends and comparisons.\\nFor additional information about each line item addressed above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 —\\nDescription of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.”\\nOur Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of\\noperations for the year ended December 31, 2021 in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\\nOperations.”\\nCritical Accounting Estimates\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates\\nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the\\nconsolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a\\nsignificant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of\\nthe Company. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting estimates addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which\\ninvolve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II,\\n“Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures.” Although we\\nbelieve that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ\\nsignificantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\\nInventories\\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost\\nand net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such\\nas through sales to individual customers, returns to product\\n21', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nvendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently\\nuncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of\\nadditional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2023, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $355 million.\\nIn addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on\\nforecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices,\\nprinciples, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other\\nconditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur\\nduring the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to\\nchange due to economic, political, and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to use our deferred tax assets.\\nOur effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new\\nbusinesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in\\njurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in\\njurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in our\\nstock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and\\ntheir valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax\\nframework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In addition, a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing\\nchanges to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals.\\nWe are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us.\\nDevelopments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for\\nwhich that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these\\nproceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations,\\nand any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\nCash flow information is as follows (in millions):\\n  Year Ended December 31,\\n 2022 2023\\nCash provided by (used in):\\nOperating activities $ 46,752 $ 84,946 \\nInvesting activities (37,601) (49,833)\\nFinancing activities 9,718 (15,879)\\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at\\nfair value, were $70.0 billion and $86.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2023. Amounts held in foreign currencies were $18.3 billion and $23.5 billion as\\nof December 31, 2022 and 2023. Our foreign currency balances include British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, Indian Rupees, and Japanese Yen.\\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities was $46.8 billion and $84.9 billion in 2022 and 2023. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash\\nreceived from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products and\\nservices, employee compensation, payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments. Cash received from our customers\\nand other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. The increase in operating cash flow in 2023, compared to the prior year, was due to an increase in\\nnet income (loss), excluding non-cash expenses, and changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables,\\nincluding variability in demand, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, customer and vendor payment\\nterms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\\nCash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from\\nproperty and equipment vendors, proceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for\\n22', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nacquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by\\n(used in) investing activities was $(37.6) billion and $(49.8) billion in 2022 and 2023, with the variability caused primarily by purchases, sales, and maturities\\nof marketable securities and cash capital expenditures. Cash capital expenditures were $58.3 billion, and $48.1 billion in 2022 and 2023, which primarily\\nreflect investments in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS business growth) and in additional capacity to support our fulfillment\\nnetwork, which investments we expect to increase in 2024. We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity\\nof $8.3 billion and $5.8 billion in 2022 and 2023. We funded the acquisitions of MGM Holdings Inc. in 2022 and 1Life Healthcare, Inc. (One Medical) in 2023\\nwith cash on hand. In 2023, we invested $1.25 billion in a note from Anthropic, PBC, which is convertible into equity. We have an agreement that expires in Q1\\n2024 to invest up to an additional $2.75 billion in a second convertible note.\\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities was $9.7 billion and $(15.9) billion in 2022 and 2023. Cash inflows from financing activities resulted\\nfrom proceeds from short-term debt, and other and long-term-debt of $62.7 billion and $18.1 billion in 2022 and 2023. Cash outflows from financing activities\\nresulted from repurchases of common stock in 2022, payments of short-term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations of $53.0\\nbillion and $34.0 billion in 2022 and 2023. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $675 million and $642 million in 2022 and 2023.\\nWe had no borrowings outstanding under the two unsecured revolving credit facilities or the commercial paper programs, we had $682 million of\\nborrowings outstanding under the secured revolving credit facility, and the entire amount of the term loan has been repaid as of December 31, 2023. See Item 8\\nof Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6 — Debt” for additional information. \\nAs of December 31, 2023, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries were $4.7 billion. We intend to invest\\nsubstantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in\\nwhich we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.\\nOur U.S. taxable income is reduced by accelerated depreciation deductions and increased by the impact of capitalized research and development\\nexpenses. U.S. tax rules provide for enhanced accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing us to expense a portion of qualified property, primarily\\nequipment. These enhanced deductions are scheduled to phase out annually from 2023 through 2026. Our federal tax provision included a partial accelerated\\ndepreciation deduction election for 2021, and a full election for 2022 and 2023. Additionally, effective January 1, 2022, research and development expenses are\\nrequired to be capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes, which delays the deductibility of these expenses. Cash paid for U.S. (federal and state) and\\nforeign income taxes (net of refunds) totaled $6.0 billion and $11.2 billion for 2022 and 2023.\\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2023, restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $365 million and $503 million. See Item 8 of Part\\nII, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6 — Debt” and “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 7 — Commitments and\\nContingencies” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, we have purchase obligations\\nand open purchase orders, including for inventory and capital expenditures, that support normal operations and are primarily due in the next twelve months.\\nThese purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.\\nWe believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing\\narrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs\\nand cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or\\ndebt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay\\ndividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position.\\nThe sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the\\nacquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity\\nrequirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or\\nfinancing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, economic conditions and actions by policymaking bodies\\nare contributing to changing interest rates and significant capital market volatility, which, along with any increases in our borrowing levels, could increase our\\nfuture borrowing costs.\\n23', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nResults of Operations\\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates\\nits business performance and manages its operations. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segment\\nInformation.”\\nOverview\\nMacroeconomic factors, including inflation, increased interest rates, significant capital market and supply chain volatility, and global economic and\\ngeopolitical developments, have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations that are difficult to isolate and quantify. In addition, changes in fuel,\\nutility, and food costs, interest rates, and economic outlook may impact customer demand and our ability to forecast consumer spending patterns. We also\\nexpect the current macroeconomic environment and enterprise customer cost optimization efforts to impact our AWS revenue growth rates. We expect some or\\nall of these factors to continue to impact our operations into Q1 2024.\\nNet Sales\\nNet sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content\\nwhere we record revenue gross. Service sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping\\nfees, AWS sales, advertising services, Amazon Prime membership fees, and certain digital media content subscriptions.

Changes in foreign exchange rates reduced cost of sales\\nby $254 million in 2023.\\nShipping costs were $83.5 billion and $89.5 billion in 2022 and 2023. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory\\nand recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers\\naccept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we use more expensive shipping methods, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs\\nof shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and\\nachieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower\\nprices is through shipping offers.\\nCosts to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as “Technology and infrastructure” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both\\nour internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers.\\nFulfillment\\nFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, physical\\nstores, and customer service centers and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in “Fulfillment,”\\nAWS costs are primarily classified as “Technology and infrastructure.” Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as\\npayment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and\\n26', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nfulfilled, the extent to which third-party sellers utilize Fulfillment by Amazon services, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent\\nwe utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by\\nimplementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment\\nprocessing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross\\npurchase price of underlying transactions.\\nThe increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2023, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased sales and investments in our\\nfulfillment network, partially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased fulfillment costs by $52 million in 2023.\\nWe seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes\\nfrom sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services.

Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and\\nother expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide\\nvariety of products and services to our customers, including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and\\nelectronic devices and the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services.\\nWe seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and infrastructure so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve\\nour process efficiency through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and infrastructure investment and\\ncapital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and\\noperations. We expect spending in technology and infrastructure to increase over time as we continue to add employees and infrastructure. These costs are\\nallocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and infrastructure costs in absolute dollars in 2023, compared to the prior year, is primarily\\ndue to an increase in spending on infrastructure and increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing\\nproducts and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings.\\nSales and Marketing\\nSales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales\\ncommissions related to AWS. We direct customers to our stores primarily through a number of marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, social and\\nonline advertising, third-party customer referrals, television advertising, and other initiatives.

Our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of\\ndiscrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. In addition, we record valuation allowances\\nagainst deferred tax assets when there is uncertainty about our ability to generate future income in relevant jurisdictions.\\nWe recorded a provision (benefit) for income taxes of $(3.2) billion and $7.1 billion in 2022 and 2023.

Net sales and related expenses generated from\\nour internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the\\nfunctional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our\\nintercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as\\nforeign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the\\nremeasurement of intercompany balances.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial\\nstatements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its\\ncash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s\\ninternal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the\\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 1, 2024 expressed an unqualified\\nopinion thereon.\\nBasis for Opinion\\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the\\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be\\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\\nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain\\nreasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included\\nperforming procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated\\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating\\nthe overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nCritical Audit Matter\\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was\\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated\\nfinancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not\\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below,\\nproviding a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\\n35', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nUncertain Tax Positions\\nDescription of\\nthe MatterAs discussed in Notes 1 and 9 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and\\nnumerous foreign jurisdictions and during the ordinary course of business, there are many tax positions for which the ultimate tax\\ndetermination is uncertain. As a result, significant judgment is required in evaluating the Company’s tax positions and determining its\\nprovision for income taxes. The Company uses significant judgment in (1) determining whether a tax position’s technical merits are\\nmore likely than not to be sustained and (2) measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. As of December 31,\\n2023, the Company reported accrued liabilities of $5.2 billion for various tax contingencies.\\nAuditing the recognition and measurement of the Company’s tax contingencies was challenging because the evaluation of whether a\\ntax position is more likely than not to be sustained and the measurement of the benefit of various tax positions can be complex and\\ninvolves significant auditor judgment. Management’s evaluation of tax positions is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal\\nrulings, and may be impacted by regulatory changes and judicial and examination activity.\\nHow We Addressed the\\nMatter in Our AuditWe tested controls over the Company’s process to assess the technical merits of its tax contingencies, including controls over: the\\nassessment as to whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained; the measurement of the benefit of its tax positions,\\nboth initially and on an ongoing basis; and the development of the related disclosures.\\nWe involved our international tax, transfer pricing, and research and development tax professionals in assessing the technical merits\\nof certain of the Company’s tax positions. Depending on the nature of the specific tax position and, as applicable, developments with\\nthe relevant tax authorities relating thereto, our procedures included obtaining and examining the Company’s analysis including the\\nCompany’s correspondence with such tax authorities and evaluating the underlying facts upon which the tax positions are based. We\\nused our knowledge of and experience with international, transfer pricing, and other income tax laws of the relevant taxing\\njurisdictions to evaluate the Company’s accounting for its tax contingencies. We evaluated developments in the applicable regulatory\\nenvironments to assess potential effects on the Company’s positions, including recent decisions in relevant court cases. We analyzed\\nthe appropriateness of the Company’s assumptions and the accuracy of the Company’s calculations and data used to determine the\\namount of tax benefits to recognize.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nNote 1 — DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, ACCOUNTING POLICIES, AND SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES\\nDescription of Business\\nWe seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers,\\ndevelopers, enterprises, content creators, advertisers, and employees. We serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price,\\nand convenience. We offer programs that enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using our services, and\\nprograms that allow authors, independent publishers, musicians, filmmakers, Twitch streamers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell content.\\nWe serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through AWS, which offers a broad set of on-demand technology services, including compute, storage,\\ndatabase, analytics, and machine learning, and other services. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices. In addition, we provide advertising services to\\nsellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising.\\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. See “Note 10 — Segment Information.”\\nCommon Stock Split\\nOn May 27, 2022, we effected a 20-for-1 stock split of our common stock and proportionately increased the number of authorized shares of common\\nstock. All share, restricted stock unit (“RSU”), and per share or per RSU information throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been retroactively\\nadjusted to reflect the stock split. The shares of common stock retain a par value of $0.01 per share. Accordingly, an amount equal to the par value of the\\nincreased shares resulting from the stock split was reclassified from “Additional paid-in capital” to “Common stock.”\\nPrior Period Reclassifications\\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. “Other assets” were reclassified out of “Accounts\\nreceivable, net and other” on our consolidated statements of cash flows.\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc. and its consolidated entities (collectively, the “Company”), consisting of\\nits wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entities in\\nIndia and certain entities that support our health care services and seller lending financing activities. Intercompany balances and transactions between\\nconsolidated entities are eliminated.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\\nliabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates\\nare used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-\\nbased compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, impairment of property and equipment and operating\\nleases, valuation and impairment of investments, self-insurance liabilities, and viewing patterns of capitalized video content. Actual results could differ\\nmaterially from these estimates. For example, in Q4 2023 we completed a useful life study for our servers and are increasing the useful life from five years to\\nsix years in January 2024, which, based on servers that are included in “Property and equipment, net” as of December 31, 2023, will have an anticipated impact\\nto our 2024 operating income of $3.1 billion. We had previously increased the useful life of our servers from four years to five years in January 2022.\\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded approximately $1.1 billion, of which $720 million was recorded in the fourth quarter, of\\nimpairments of property and equipment and operating leases primarily related to physical stores. These charges were recorded in “Other operating expense\\n(income), net” on our consolidated statements of operations and primarily impacted our North America segment. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we\\nalso recorded expenses of approximately $480 million, primarily in “Fulfillment”, on our consolidated statements of operations primarily relating to\\nterminating contracts for certain leases not yet commenced as well as other purchase commitments, which primarily impacted our North America segment.\\n42', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded approximately $720 million, of which $640 million was recorded in the fourth quarter, of estimated\\nseverance costs primarily related to planned role eliminations. These charges were recorded primarily in “Technology and infrastructure,” “Fulfillment,” and\\n“General and administrative” on our consolidated statements of operations and primarily impacted our North America segment.\\nCharges for impairment, expenses for terminating contracts and other commitments, and severance costs were not material to our consolidated results of\\noperations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2023.\\nSupplemental Cash Flow Information\\nThe following table shows supplemental cash flow information (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2021 2022 2023\\nSUPPLEMENT AL CASH FLOW  INFORMA TION:\\nCash paid for interest on debt, net of capitalized interest $ 1,098 $ 1,561 $ 2,608 \\nCash paid for operating leases $ 6,722 $ 8,633 $ 10,453 \\nCash paid for interest on finance leases $ 521 $ 374 $ 308 \\nCash paid for interest on financing obligations $ 153 $ 207 $ 196 \\nCash paid for income taxes, net of refunds $ 3,688 $ 6,035 $ 11,179 \\nAssets acquired under operating leases $ 25,369 $ 18,800 $ 14,052 \\nProperty and equipment acquired under finance leases, net of remeasurements and modifications $ 7,061 $ 675 $ 642 \\nProperty and equipment recognized during the construction period of build-to-suit lease arrangements $ 5,846 $ 3,187 $ 357 \\nProperty and equipment derecognized after the construction period of build-to-suit lease arrangements, with\\nthe associated leases recognized as operating $ 230 $ 5,158 $ 1,374 \\nEarnings Per Share\\nBasic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our\\nweighted-average outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we\\nhave a net loss, stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect.\\nThe following table shows the calculation of diluted shares (in millions):\\n  Year Ended December 31,\\n 2021 2022 2023\\nShares used in computation of basic earnings per share 10,117 10,189 10,304 \\nTotal dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards 179 — 188 \\nShares used in computation of diluted earnings per share 10,296 10,189 10,492 \\nRevenue\\nRevenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return allowances, promotional discounts,\\nand rebates. Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have\\nmultiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally\\ndetermine stand-alone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin.\\nA description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows:\\nRetail sales - We offer consumer products through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the\\ncustomer, which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.\\nThird-party seller services - We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders using our services. We are not the\\nseller of record in these transactions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the\\nservices are rendered, which generally occurs upon delivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the\\ncustomer.\\n43', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nAdvertising services - We provide advertising services to sellers, vendors, publishers, authors, and others, through programs such as sponsored ads,\\ndisplay, and video advertising. Revenue is recognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks or impressions.\\nSubscription services - Our subscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to content including digital video,\\naudiobooks, digital music, e-books, and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of\\nbenefits that represent a single stand-ready obligation. Subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such\\narrangements is recognized over the subscription period.\\nAWS - Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is allocated to services using stand-alone\\nselling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, based on the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage\\ncapacity delivered on-demand. Certain services, including compute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is\\nrecognized ratably. Sales commissions we pay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term.\\nOther - Other revenue includes sales related to various other offerings, such as certain licensing and distribution of video content, health care services,\\nand shipping services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Revenue is recognized when content is licensed or distributed and as or when services are\\nperformed.\\nReturn Allowances\\nReturn allowances, which reduce revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Liabilities for return allowances are included in\\n“Accrued expenses and other” and were $1.0 billion, $1.3 billion, and $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023. Additions to the allowance were\\n$5.1 billion, $5.5 billion, and $5.2 billion and deductions from the allowance were $4.9 billion, $5.2 billion, and $5.1 billion in 2021, 2022, and 2023. Included\\nin “Inventories” on our consolidated balance sheets are assets totaling $882 million, $948 million, and $992 million as of December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023,\\nfor the rights to recover products from customers associated with our liabilities for return allowances.\\nCost of Sales\\nCost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, inbound and outbound shipping costs, including costs related to sortation and\\ndelivery centers and where we are the transportation service provider, and digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and\\nmusic. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our\\ncustomers. Payment processing and related transaction costs, including those associated with seller transactions, are classified in “Fulfillment” on our\\nconsolidated statements of operations.\\nVendor Agreements\\nWe have agreements with our vendors to receive consideration primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, incentives, and volume\\nrebates. We generally consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment,\\nor services, and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically depend on\\nreaching minimum purchase thresholds. We evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds using past experience and current year forecasts. When\\nvolume rebates can be reasonably estimated, we record a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold.\\nFulfillment\\nFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International segments’ fulfillment centers,\\nphysical stores, and customer service centers, including facilities and equipment expenses, such as depreciation and amortization, and rent; costs attributable to\\nbuying, receiving, inspecting, and warehousing inventories; picking, packaging, and preparing customer orders for shipment; payment processing and related\\ntransaction costs, including costs associated with our guarantee for certain seller transactions; responding to inquiries from customers; and supply chain\\nmanagement for our manufactured electronic devices. Fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to third parties that assist us in fulfillment and customer\\nservice operations.\\n44', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nTechnology and Infrastructure\\nTechnology and infrastructure costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing\\nproducts and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores,\\nand infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and\\nother expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide\\nvariety of products and services to our customers, including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and\\nelectronic devices and the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services. Technology and\\ninfrastructure costs are generally expensed as incurred.\\nSales and Marketing\\nSales and marketing costs include advertising and payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, including sales\\ncommissions related to AWS. We pay commissions to third parties when their customer referrals result in sales. We also participate in cooperative advertising\\narrangements with certain of our vendors, and other third parties.\\nAdvertising and other promotional costs to market our products and services are expensed as incurred and were $16.9 billion, $20.6 billion, and $20.3\\nbillion in 2021, 2022, and 2023.\\nGeneral and Administrative\\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for corporate functions, including payroll and related expenses; facilities and equipment\\nexpenses, such as depreciation and amortization expense and rent; and professional fees.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nCompensation cost for all equity-classified stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the service\\nperiod. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is\\nrecognized as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. Under this method, approximately 50% of the grant\\ndate fair value is recognized as expense in the first year of grant for the majority of our stock-based compensation awards. The accelerated method also adds a\\nhigher level of sensitivity and complexity in estimating forfeitures. If an award is forfeited early in its life, the adjustment to compensation expense is much\\ngreater under an accelerated method than under a straight-line method. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and\\nto the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period\\nestimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including historical forfeiture experience by grant year and employee\\nlevel. Additionally, stock-based compensation includes stock appreciation rights that are expected to settle in cash. These liability-classified awards are\\nremeasured to fair value at the end of each reporting period until settlement or expiration.\\nOther Operating Expense (Income), Net\\nOther operating expense (income), net, consists primarily of the amortization of intangible assets, and asset impairments for physical store closures in\\n2022 and for fulfillment network facilities and physical store closures in 2023.\\nOther Income (Expense), Net\\nOther income (expense), net, is as follows (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2021 2022 2023\\nMarketable equity securities valuation gains (losses) $ 11,526 $ (13,870)$ 984 \\nEquity warrant valuation gains (losses) 1,315 (2,132) 26 \\nUpward adjustments relating to equity investments in private companies 1,866 76 40 \\nForeign currency gains (losses) (55) (340) 65 \\nOther, net (19) (540) (177)\\nTotal other income (expense), net $ 14,633 $ (16,806)$ 938 \\n45', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nIncluded in other income (expense), net in 2022 and 2023 is a marketable equity securities valuation gain (loss) of $(12.7) billion and $797 million from\\nour equity investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc. (“Rivian”). Our investment in Rivian’s preferred stock was accounted for at cost, with adjustments for\\nobservable changes in prices or impairments, prior to Rivian’s initial public offering in November 2021, which resulted in the conversion of our preferred stock\\nto Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2023, we held 158 million shares of Rivian’s Class A common stock, representing an approximate 16%\\nownership interest, and an approximate 15% voting interest. We determined that we have the ability to exercise significant influence over Rivian through our\\nequity investment, our commercial arrangement for the purchase of electric vehicles and jointly-owned intellectual property, and one of our employees serving\\non Rivian’s board of directors. We elected the fair value option to account for our equity investment in Rivian, which is included in “Marketable securities” on\\nour consolidated balance sheets, and had a fair value of $2.9 billion and $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023. The investment was\\nsubject to regulatory sales restrictions resulting in a discount for lack of marketability of approximately $800 million as of December 31, 2021, which expired\\nin Q1 2022.\\nRequired summarized financial information of Rivian as disclosed in its most recent SEC filings is as follows (in millions):\\nYear Ended\\nDecember 31, 2021Year Ended\\nDecember 31, 2022Nine Months Ended\\nSeptember 30, 2023\\nRevenues $ 55 $ 1,658 $ 3,119 \\nGross profit (465) (3,123) (1,424)\\nLoss from operations (4,220) (6,856) (4,158)\\nNet loss (4,688) (6,752) (3,911)\\nDecember 31, 2022 September 30, 2023\\nTotal current assets $ 13,130 $ 12,086 \\nTotal assets 17,876 16,456 \\nTotal current liabilities 2,424 2,624 \\nTotal liabilities 4,077 5,904 \\nIncome Taxes\\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S.\\ntaxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary\\nearnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional\\ncosts upon repatriation of such amounts.\\nDeferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases, as\\nwell as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered.\\nDeferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future periods. Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization\\nand reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future\\nrealization of our deferred tax assets, including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains and investment in such\\njurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.\\nWe utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (income tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the\\ntax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not the position will be sustained on audit,\\nincluding resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely\\nof being realized upon ultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require\\nperiodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our income tax contingencies in\\nincome tax expense.\\n46', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants\\nat the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to\\nmeasure fair value:\\nLevel 1 — Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.\\nLevel 2 — Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and\\nliabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are\\nobservable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\\nLevel 3 — Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by\\nother market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.\\nWe measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or\\nliabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar\\ninstruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold significant amounts of marketable securities\\ncategorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2023.\\nWe hold equity warrants giving us the right to acquire stock of other companies. As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, these warrants had a fair value of\\n$2.1 billion and $2.2 billion, and are recorded within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets with gains and losses recognized in “Other income\\n(expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. These warrants are classified as Level 2 and 3 assets.\\nCash and Cash Equivalents\\nWe classify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.\\nInventories\\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost\\nand net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such\\nas through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. The\\ninventory valuation allowance, representing a write-down of inventory, was $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2023.\\nWe provide Fulfillment by Amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers’ programs. Third-party sellers maintain ownership of their\\ninventory, regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these products are not included in our inventories.\\nWe also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for\\nour products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements\\nwith contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device components. We have certain non-cancellable purchase commitments arising from these\\nagreements. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. We also have\\nfirm, non-cancellable commitments for certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores.\\nAccounts Receivable, Net and Other\\nIncluded in “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are receivables primarily related to customers, vendors, and sellers,\\nas well as prepaid expenses and other current assets. As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, customer receivables, net, were $26.6 billion and $34.1 billion,\\nvendor receivables, net, were $6.9 billion and $8.5 billion, seller receivables, net, were $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion, and other receivables, net, were $3.1\\nbillion and $3.3 billion. Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provides funding to sellers primarily to\\nprocure inventory. Prepaid expenses and other current assets were $4.5 billion and $5.4 billion as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023.\\nWe estimate losses on receivables based on expected losses, including our historical experience of actual losses. Receivables are considered impaired and\\nwritten-off when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for\\ndoubtful accounts was $1.1 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023. Additions to the allowance were $1.0 billion, $1.6\\nbillion, and $1.9 billion, and deductions to the allowance were $1.1 billion, $1.3 billion, and $1.6 billion in 2021, 2022, and 2023.\\n47', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nSoftware Development Costs\\nWe incur software development costs related to products to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, internal-use software, and our websites.\\nSoftware development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented. All other costs, including those related to design or maintenance, are\\nexpensed as incurred.\\nProperty and Equipment, Net\\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Incentives that we receive from property and equipment\\nvendors are recorded as a reduction to our costs. Property includes buildings and land that we own, along with property we have acquired under build-to-suit\\nlease arrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period and finance lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as\\nservers and networking equipment, heavy equipment, and other fulfillment equipment. Depreciation and amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over\\nthe estimated useful lives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, four years prior to January 1, 2022 and\\nfive years subsequent to January 1, 2022 for our servers, five years prior to January 1, 2022 and six years subsequent to January 1, 2022 for our networking\\nequipment, ten years for heavy equipment, and three to ten years for other fulfillment equipment). Depreciation and amortization expense is classified within\\nthe corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations.\\nLeases\\nWe categorize leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are generally those leases that allow\\nus to substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired under finance leases are recorded in “Property and equipment, net.”\\nAll other leases are categorized as operating leases. Our leases generally have terms that range from one to ten years for equipment and one to twenty years for\\nproperty.\\nCertain lease contracts include obligations to pay for other services, such as operations and maintenance. For leases of property, we account for these\\nother services as a component of the lease. For substantially all other leases, the services are accounted for separately and we allocate payments to the lease and\\nother services components based on estimated stand-alone prices.\\nLease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives using a discount rate based on similarly\\nsecured borrowings available to us. Lease assets are recognized based on the initial present value of the fixed lease payments, reduced by landlord incentives,\\nplus any direct costs from executing the leases or lease prepayments reclassified from “Other assets” upon lease commencement. Leasehold improvements are\\ncapitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the lease term.\\nWhen we have the option to extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, or purchase the leased asset, and it is\\nreasonably certain that we will exercise the option, we consider the option in determining the classification and measurement of the lease. Our leases may\\ninclude variable payments based on measures that include changes in price indices, market interest rates, or the level of sales at a physical store, which are\\nexpensed as incurred.\\nCosts associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease. Finance lease\\nassets are amortized within operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title\\ndoes not transfer at the end of the lease term, the lease term. The interest component of a finance lease is included in interest expense and recognized using the\\neffective interest method over the lease term.\\nWe establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such\\nassets are amortized over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.\\nFinancing Obligations\\nWe record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under build-to-suit lease arrangements when we have control over the building during the\\nconstruction period. If we continue to control the building after the construction period, the arrangement is classified as a financing obligation instead of a\\nlease. The building is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life or the term of the obligation.\\nIf we do not control the building after the construction period ends, the assets and liabilities for construction costs are derecognized, and we classify the\\nlease as operating.\\n48', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\\nWe evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change\\nthat indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the\\nfair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value and if so, we perform a quantitative test. We compare the carrying\\nvalue of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset to its estimated fair value and if the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value,\\nwe recognize an impairment loss for the difference. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows\\nare based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and\\ngeneral economic conditions.\\nWe completed the required annual impairment test of goodwill for all reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of April 1, 2023, resulting\\nin no impairments. The fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value. There were no events that caused us to update our annual\\nimpairment test. See “Note 5 — Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets.”\\nOther Assets\\nIncluded in “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to video and music content, net of accumulated amortization;\\nlong-term deferred tax assets; acquired intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization; equity warrant assets and certain equity investments; satellite\\nnetwork launch services deposits; and affordable housing loans. We recognize certain transactions with governments when there is reasonable assurance that\\nincentives included in the agreements, such as cash or certain tax credits, will be received and we are able to comply with any related conditions. These\\nincentives are recorded as reductions to the cost of related assets or expenses.\\nDigital Video and Music Content\\nWe obtain video content, inclusive of episodic television and movies, and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide\\nrange of licensing provisions including both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific video or music title is determinable or\\nreasonably estimable and the content is available to us, we recognize an asset and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We reduce the liability as\\npayments are made and we amortize the asset to “Cost of sales” on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line\\nbasis. If the licensing fee is not determinable or reasonably estimable, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. We also\\ndevelop original video content for which the production costs are capitalized and amortized to “Cost of sales” predominantly on an accelerated basis that\\nfollows the estimated viewing patterns associated with the content. The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 3.5 years. We\\nreview usage and viewing patterns impacting the amortization of capitalized video content on an ongoing basis and reflect any changes prospectively.\\nOur produced and licensed video content is primarily monetized together as a unit, referred to as a film group, in each major geography where we offer\\nAmazon Prime memberships. These film groups are evaluated for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating the fair value is\\nless than the carrying value. The total capitalized costs of video, which is primarily released content, and music as of December 31, 2022 and 2023 were $16.7\\nbillion and $17.4 billion. Total video and music expense was $16.6 billion and $18.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2023. Total video and\\nmusic expense includes licensing and production costs associated with content offered within Amazon Prime memberships, and costs associated with digital\\nsubscriptions and sold or rented content.\\nInvestments\\nWe generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term marketable debt securities.\\nSuch investments are included in “Cash and cash equivalents” or “Marketable securities” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\\nMarketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other\\ncomprehensive income (loss).” Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair value below carrying value are due to expected credit losses, as well\\nas our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs. Expected credit losses are recorded as an allowance through “Other income\\n(expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations.\\nConvertible notes classified as available for sale, equity investments in private companies for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant\\ninfluence and accounted for at cost, and equity investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting are included within “Other assets” on our\\nconsolidated balance sheets.\\n49', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nIn Q3 2023, we invested in a $1.25 billion note from Anthropic, PBC, which is convertible to equity. The note is classified as available for sale and\\nreported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” The note is classified as a Level 3 asset.\\nWe have an agreement that expires in Q1 2024 to invest up to an additional $2.75 billion in a second convertible note. We also have a commercial arrangement\\nprimarily for the provision of AWS cloud services, which includes the use of AWS chips.\\nEquity investments in private companies for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for at cost, with adjustments\\nfor observable changes in prices or impairments, with adjustments recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations.\\nEach reporting period, we perform a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether the investment is impaired. Our assessment includes a review of recent\\noperating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. If the investment is impaired, we write it\\ndown to its estimated fair value. As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, these investments had a carrying value of $715 million and $754 million.\\nEquity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, or at fair value if we elect the fair value option, if the investment gives us\\nthe ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Our share of the earnings or losses as reported by equity-method investees,\\namortization of basis differences, related gains or losses, and impairments, if any, are recognized in “Equity-method investment activity, net of tax” on our\\nconsolidated statements of operations. Each reporting period, we evaluate whether declines in fair value below carrying value are other-than-temporary and if\\nso, we write down the investment to its estimated fair value.\\nEquity investments that have readily determinable fair values, including investments for which we have elected the fair value option, are included in\\n“Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with changes recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our\\nconsolidated statements of operations.\\nLong-Lived Assets\\nLong-lived assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances\\nindicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant\\ndecline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse\\nchange that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable.\\nFor long-lived assets used in operations, including lease assets, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable\\nthrough its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and\\nestimated fair value. Long-lived assets are considered held for sale when certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell\\nthe asset, the asset is available for sale in its immediate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date. Assets held for sale are\\nreported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale were not significant as of December 31, 2022 and 2023.\\nAccrued Expenses and Other\\nIncluded in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to leases and asset retirement obligations,\\ntax-related liabilities, current debt, payroll and related expenses, unredeemed gift cards, self-insurance liabilities, customer liabilities, marketing liabilities,\\nacquired digital media content, and other operating expenses.\\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2023, our liabilities for payroll related expenses were $7.7 billion and our liabilities for unredeemed gift cards were $5.4\\nbillion and $5.3 billion. We reduce the liability for a gift card when redeemed by a customer. The portion of gift cards that we do not expect to be redeemed is\\nrecognized based on customer usage patterns.\\nSelf-Insurance Liabilities\\nAlthough we maintain certain high-deductible, third-party insurance coverage for catastrophic losses, we effectively self-insure for exposure primarily\\nrelated to workers’ compensation, employee health care benefits, general and product liability, and automobile liability, including liability resulting from third-\\nparty transportation service providers. We estimate self-insurance liabilities by considering historical claims experience, frequency and costs of claims,\\nprojected claims development, inflation, and other actuarial assumptions. Changes in the number or costs of claims, healthcare costs, judgment and settlement\\namounts, associated legal expenses, and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we\\nincreased our reserves for general, product, and automobile liabilities by $1.3 billion primarily driven by changes in our estimates about the costs of asserted\\nand unasserted claims, which was primarily recorded in “Cost of sales” on our consolidated statements of operations and impacted our North America segment.\\nIncreases to our reserves driven by changes in estimates were not material to our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and\\n50', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\n2023. As of December 31, 2022 and 2023, our total self-insurance liabilities were $4.0 billion and $6.3 billion and are included in “Accrued expenses and\\nother” on our consolidated balance sheets.\\nUnearned Revenue\\nUnearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service\\nperiod. Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31,\\n2022 was $16.1 billion, of which $12.4 billion was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2023 and our total unearned revenue as of\\nDecember 31, 2023 was $20.6 billion. Included in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets was $2.9 billion and $5.7 billion of unearned\\nrevenue as of December 31, 2022 and 2023.\\nAdditionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that\\nhave not yet been recognized in our financial statements. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were\\n$155.7 billion as of December 31, 2023. The weighted average remaining life of our long-term contracts is 4.0 years. However, the amount and timing of\\nrevenue recognition is largely driven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term.\\nOther Long-Term Liabilities\\nIncluded in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to financing obligations, unearned revenue,\\nasset retirement obligations, tax contingencies, digital video and music content, and deferred tax liabilities.\\nForeign Currency\\nWe have internationally-focused stores for which the net sales generated, as well as most of the related expenses directly incurred from those operations,\\nare denominated in local functional currencies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these stores is generally the same as\\nthe local currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at period-end foreign exchange rates, and revenues and expenses\\nare translated at average rates prevailing throughout the period. Translation adjustments are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a\\nseparate component of stockholders’ equity. Transaction gains and losses including intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the\\nfunctional currency of the entity involved are included in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the\\nsettlement and remeasurement of intercompany balances, we recorded gains (losses) of $19 million, $386 million, and $(329) million in 2021, 2022, and 2023.\\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) amending existing income tax disclosure\\nguidance, primarily requiring more detailed disclosure for income taxes paid and the effective tax rate reconciliation. The ASU is effective for annual reporting\\nperiods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted and can be applied on either a prospective or retroactive basis. We are currently\\nevaluating the ASU to determine its impact on our income tax disclosures.\\n51', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nNote 2 — FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Marketable Securities\\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2023, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities primarily consisted of cash, AAA-rated money\\nmarket funds, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, other investment grade securities, and marketable equity securities.

The complaint alleges, among other things, that the use of “interactive features” on www.amazon.com, including “search suggestions and search\\nresults,” infringes U.S. Patent No. 9,195,507, entitled “Distributed\\n60', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nHypermedia Method and System for Automatically Invoking External Application Providing Interaction and Display of Embedded Objects Within a\\nHypermedia Document.” The complaint sought a judgment of infringement together with costs and attorneys’ fees. In February 2016, Eolas filed an amended\\ncomplaint seeking, among other things, an unspecified amount of damages. In February 2017, Eolas alleged in its damages report that in the event of a finding\\nof liability Amazon could be subject to $130 million to $250 million in damages. In April 2017, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for\\nthe Northern District of California. In May 2022, the district court granted summary judgment, holding that the patent is invalid. In June 2022, Eolas filed a\\nnotice of appeal. In February 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the district court’s judgment. We dispute the allegations\\nof wrongdoing and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.\\nIn May 2018, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and CF Dynamic Advances LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District\\nCourt for the Northern District of New York. The complaint alleges, among other things, that “Alexa Voice Software and Alexa enabled devices” infringe U.S.\\nPatent No. 7,177,798, entitled “Natural Language Interface Using Constrained Intermediate Dictionary of Results.” The complaint seeks an injunction, an\\nunspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, an ongoing royalty, interest, attorneys’ fees, and costs. In March 2023, the plaintiffs alleged in their\\ndamages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to $140 million to $267 million in damages. We dispute the allegations of\\nwrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.\\nIn December 2018, Kove IO, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern District of\\nIllinois. The complaint alleges, among other things, that Amazon S3 and DynamoDB infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 7,814,170 and 7,103,640, each entitled\\n“Network Distributed Tracking Wire Transfer Protocol”; and 7,233,978, entitled “Method and Apparatus for Managing Location Information in a Network\\nSeparate from the Data to Which the Location Information Pertains.” The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys’\\nfees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. In March 2022, the case was stayed pending resolution of review petitions we filed with the United States Patent and\\nTrademark Office. In November 2022, the stay was lifted.

We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously\\nin this matter.\\nBeginning in June 2019 with Wilcosky v. Amazon.com, Inc., now pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (“N.D.\\nIll.”), private litigants have filed a number of cases in U.S. federal and state courts, including Hogan v. Amazon.com, Inc. (N.D. Ill.), alleging, among other\\nthings, that Amazon’s collection, storage, use, retention, and protection of biometric identifiers violated the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act. The\\ncomplaints allege purported classes of Illinois residents who had biometric identifiers collected through Amazon products or services, including Amazon\\nPhotos, Alexa, AWS cloud services, Ring, Amazon Connect, Amazon’s Flex driver app, and Amazon’s virtual try-on technology. The complaints seek\\ncertification as class actions, unspecified amounts of damages, injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees, costs, and interest.

Attorneys General for the District of Columbia and California brought similar suits in May 2021 and September 2022 in the Superior Court\\nof the District of Columbia and the California Superior Court for the County of San Francisco, respectively. Some of the private cases include allegations of\\nseveral distinct purported classes, including consumers who purchased a product through Amazon’s stores and consumers who purchased a product offered by\\nAmazon through another e-commerce retailer. The complaints seek billions of dollars of alleged damages, treble damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief,\\ncivil penalties, attorneys’ fees, and costs. The Federal Trade Commission and a number of state Attorneys General filed a similar lawsuit in September 2023 in\\nthe W.D. Wash. alleging violations of federal antitrust and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. That complaint alleges, among other things, that\\nAmazon has a monopoly in markets for online superstores and marketplace services, and unlawfully maintains those monopolies through anticompetitive\\npractices relating to our pricing policies, advertising practices, the structure of Prime, and promotion of our own products on our website. The complaint seeks\\ninjunctive and structural relief, an unspecified amount of damages, and costs. Amazon’s motions to dismiss were granted in part and denied in part in Frame-\\nWilson in March 2022 and March 2023, De Coster v. Amazon.com, Inc. (W.D. Wash.) in January 2023, and the California Attorney General’s lawsuit in March\\n2023. All three courts dismissed claims alleging that Amazon’s pricing policies are inherently illegal and denied dismissal of claims alleging that Amazon’s\\npricing policies are an unlawful restraint of trade. In March 2022, the DC Superior Court dismissed the DC Attorney General’s lawsuit in its entirety; the\\ndismissal is under appeal. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.\\nIn October 2020, Broadband iTV, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc., Amazon.com Services LLC, and Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the\\nUnited States District Court for the Western District of Texas.

In April 2022, Broadband iTV alleged in its damages report that in the\\nevent of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to $166 million to $986 million in damages. In September 2022, the court granted summary judgment,\\nholding that the patents are invalid. In October 2022, Broadband iTV filed a notice of appeal.

On October 4, 2017, the European\\nCommission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on\\nthat decision, the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately €250 million, plus interest, for the period May 2006\\nthrough June 2014, and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg computed an\\ninitial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission’s decision, which we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending\\nconclusion of all appeals. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission’s decision. In May 2018, we appealed.

It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax\\nauthorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to\\nour contingencies related to positions on prior years’ tax filings. The actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing\\nand nature of any settlements.

As a result of this\\nassessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance\\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted\\naccounting principles. Ernst & Young has independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and its report is included\\nbelow.\\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 that materially affected, or are\\nreasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\\nLimitations on Controls\\nOur disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their\\nobjectives as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial\\nreporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can\\nprovide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that\\nmisstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.\\n71', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\\nThe Board of Directors and Shareholders\\nAmazon.com, Inc.\\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nWe have audited Amazon.com, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-\\nIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our\\nopinion, Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023,\\nbased on the COSO criteria.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated\\nbalance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss),\\nstockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 and the related notes and our report dated February 1,\\n2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\\nBasis for Opinion\\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness\\nof internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our\\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered\\nwith the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules\\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\\nassurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and\\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered\\nnecessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting\\nand the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control\\nover financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly\\nreflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being\\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation\\nof effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nSeattle, Washington\\nFebruary 1, 2024\\n72', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Table of Contents\\nItem 9B.

Prior to any event in connection with the Award (e.g., vesting) that gives rise to a Tax-Related\\nItems obligation, you must arrange for the satisfaction of such Tax -Related Items in a manner acceptable to the Company and the Employer.\\n(i) By Sale of Shares. Unless you choose to satisfy the Tax-Related Items by some other means in accordance with clause (ii)\\nbelow, your acceptance of this Award constitutes your instruction and authorization to the Company and the Designated Broker to sell on your behalf\\na number of Shares from those Shares issued to you as the Company determines to be appropriate to generate cash proceeds sufficient to satisfy your\\nobligation for Tax-Related\\n2', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'}), Document(page_content=\"Items. Such Shares will be sold on the day of the event giving rise to the Tax-Related Items (e.g., a Vest Date) or as soon thereafter as practicable. You will be\\nresponsible for all broker's fees and other costs of sale, and you agree to indemnify and hold the Company harmless from any losses, costs, damages, or\\nexpenses relating to any such sale. The number of Shares sold may be determined by considering any applicable withholding rates, including maximum\\napplicable rates, and to the extent the proceeds of such sale exceed your obligation for Tax-Related Items, the Company agrees to pay such excess in cash to\\nyou through payroll or otherwise as soon as practicable and you acknowledge that you have no entitlement to the equivalent in Shares. You further\\nacknowledge that the Company or its designee is under no obligation to arrange for such sale at any particular price, and that the proceeds of any such sale may\\nnot be sufficient to satisfy your obligation for Tax-Related Items. Accordingly, you agree to pay to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries including the\\nEmployer as soon as practicable, including through additional payroll withholding, any amount of the Tax -Related Items that is not satisfied by the sale of\\nShares described above.\\n(ii) By Wire Transfer or Other Means. At any time not less than five business days before any obligation for Tax-Related Items arises\\n(e.g., a Vest Date), you may elect to satisfy your obligation for Tax-Related Items by delivering to the Company an amount that the Company determines is\\nsufficient to satisfy the Tax-Related Items by wire transfer to such account as the Company may direct, or such other means as the Company may establish or\\npermit. If you have made an election to satisfy your obligation for Tax-Related Items by wire transfer or other means and, as determined by the Company, have\\nnot adequately funded the obligation for Tax-Related Items within five business days before a Vest Date for this Award or any other award of restricted stock\\nunits granted to you under the Plan, the Company reserves the right to satisfy your obligation for Tax-Related Items pursuant to the method described above in\\n9(b)(i).\\n(c) Right to Retain Shares or Cash. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver any Shares or the proceeds from the sale of Shares\\nto you until the obligation for any Tax-Related Items due in connection with the Award has been satisfied. To the extent permitted by law, the Company has the\\nright to retain, without notice, from Shares issuable under the Award, Shares having a value sufficient to satisfy the Tax-Related Items. Further, the Company\\nor the Employer has the right to retain, without notice, from salary or other amounts payable to you, cash sufficient to satisfy the Tax-Related Items. If your\\nobligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by the Company withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of\\nShares subject to the vested Award, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items. You agree\\nto pay to the Company or the Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or the Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a\\nresult of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means described in this Section 9.\\n10. Registration. The Company currently has an effective registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with\\nrespect to the Shares subject to the Award. The Company intends to maintain this registration but has no obligation to do so. If the registration ceases to be\\neffective, you will not be able to transfer or sell Shares issued to you pursuant to the Award unless exemptions from registration under applicable securities\\nlaws are available. Such exemptions from registration are very limited and might be unavailable. You agree that any resale by you of the Shares issued\\npursuant to the Award shall comply in all respects with the requirements of all applicable securities laws, rules and regulations, including, without limitation,\\nthe provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and any other law, rule or regulation\\nincluding, without limitation, applicable securities law and exchange control regulations for your country of residence, as all may be amended from time to\\ntime.

This paragraph shall apply only to Incentive-Based Compensation Received by a person on or after\\nOctober 2, 2023 and after the person began service as an Executive Officer if the person served as an Executive Officer at any time during the performance\\nperiod for the Incentive-Based Compensation. The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee or another committee appointed by the Board (the\\n“Committee”) will interpret and administer this paragraph, including capitalized terms not otherwise defined, consistent with and in compliance with, and\\nsubject to the exceptions set forth in, Nasdaq Rule 5608.\\nIn addition, if the Committee determines that a current or former Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President, or Section 16 officer\\n(“Officer”) of the Company engaged in fraud or intentional misconduct that caused or contributed to an obligation to restate the Company’s financial\\nstatements, the Committee may require, to the extent not recovered pursuant to the first paragraph of this Policy, the Officer to return or forfeit all or a portion\\nof the shares subject to any vested or unvested equity award that was settled or granted during or within 12 months after the period that such conduct occurred\\nor remained uncorrected, as well as all or a portion of any cash bonus paid or awarded during such time period. The Committee may also require the Officer to\\npay to the Company the gross proceeds from any sale or other disposition of shares, pursuant to a Company vested equity award, that occurred during or within\\n12 months after the period that such conduct occurred or remained uncorrected. The return of shares and repayment of proceeds is in addition to and separate\\nfrom any other relief available to the Company due to the Officer’s conduct. Any determination by the Board or Committee with respect to the foregoing shall\\nbe final, conclusive, and binding on all interested parties.', metadata={'year': 2023, 'source': 'AMZ-2023-10-k.pdf'})]\n",
